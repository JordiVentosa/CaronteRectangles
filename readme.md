# Data Prediction with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates how to build and train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for data prediction. The main steps include data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation. Additionally, we handle missing entries by filling each user with new tramesa entries with a grade of 0 for each tramesa they hadn't done.

## Importing Libraries
We start by importing essential libraries required for data manipulation, visualization, and building the RNN model. These include `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `tensorflow/keras`.

## Loading and Preprocessing Data
We load our dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, normalizing the data, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

## Filling Missing Tramesa Entries
We fill each user with new tramesa entries with a grade of 0 for each tramesa they hadn't done. This ensures that all users have the same number of tramesa entries, which is necessary for training the RNN model.

## Data Exploration and Visualization
We explore the dataset to understand its structure and visualize key statistics. This helps in identifying patterns and potential issues in the data.

## Data Cleaning
We clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting any inconsistencies. This step is crucial for ensuring the quality of the data before feeding it into the model.

## Feature Engineering
We create new features from the existing data to improve the model's performance. This might include creating time-based features, aggregating data, or encoding categorical variables.

## Splitting the Data
We split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

## Building the RNN Model
We define the architecture of our Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This involves adding RNN layers (e.g., LSTM or GRU), specifying activation functions, and compiling the model with an optimizer and loss function.

## Model Training
We train the RNN model using the training data and monitor the training process using the validation data to prevent overfitting and ensure the model generalizes well.

## Model Evaluation
We evaluate the trained model on the test data to assess its performance. We use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the model's effectiveness.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
We perform hyperparameter tuning to find the best set of parameters for our model. This involves experimenting with different values for learning rate, batch size, number of layers, etc.

## Saving the Model
We save the trained model to disk so that it can be loaded and used later without retraining. This is useful for deploying the model in a production environment.

## Loading the Model
We load a previously saved model from disk. This allows us to use the model for making predictions without having to retrain it.

## Making Predictions
We use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data. This step demonstrates how the model can be used in a real-world scenario.

## Conclusion
We summarize the findings and results of our project. We discuss the model's performance, potential improvements, and next steps.
